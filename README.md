## **Installation Instructions**
First, you'll want to fork this repository down to your local machine. Once forked, I would suggest copying the files into your project folder, rather than just moving them (it's always nice to keep the original as a backup in case you need to start over). Once the files are copied over into your project folder, simply open your command line and run node on the index.js file.

## **How to Use README.md Generator**
When you run node on the index.js file, you will be prompted with a series of questions asking for information about your application. Be sure to answer accurately, because this is the data that will be used to create the README.md file, so be as descriptive as you want! If successful, you will see a message reading "You did it!" at the bottom of your command line. You can then go back into your project folder, open the README.md file, and see the magic!
